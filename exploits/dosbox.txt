***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * Note that the name of the written file in the following example will be
      FILE_TO_.
      LFILE='\path\to\file_to_write'
      sudo dosbox -c 'mount c /' -c "echo DATA >c:$LFILE" -c exit
