***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * Each input line is treated as a filename for the file command and the
      output is corrupted by a suffix : followed by the result or the error of
      the operation, so this may not be suitable for binary files.
