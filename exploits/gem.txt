***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * This requires the name of an installed gem to be provided (rdoc is
      usually installed).
      sudo gem open -e "/bin/sh -c /bin/sh" rdoc
