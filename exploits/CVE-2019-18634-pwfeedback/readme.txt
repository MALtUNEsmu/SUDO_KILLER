This exploited was tested on sudo version 1.8.25. It should be noted that depending of the version and which linux-based OS it is (e.g. Ubuntu or Archlinux), the offset changes.
In order to exploit other version of sudo, you will need to change the initial exploit a bit (mostly the offset).

    "1.8.21": 0x270
    "1.8.25": 0x256
    "1.8.30": 0x224

The exploited provided in SK makes use of SOCAT and perl, an executable copy of socat is provided in this directory, else you can download it.
